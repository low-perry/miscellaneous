                    "Disrupt the status quo with the Malibu Special, a small-body, short scale acoustic-electric with a comfortable feel that will encourage you to reach for new chords and melodies. Featuring solid mahogany top, back and sides, the bold style and balanced, articulate sound make the Malibu Special a natural partner on stage and in the studio. Suitable for any playing style, the mahogany neck features a comfortable, slim-taper \"C\"-shaped profile, inspired by Fender’s electric legacy. It also includes a premium Fender- and Fishman-designed preamp system voiced specifically for the Malibu’s body shape, allowing you to reproduce the guitar’s natural sound when plugged into an amplifier. The Malibu Special’s no-compromise attitude extends to its build quality, featuring quartersawn scalloped X bracing for superior resonance, an upgraded bone nut and saddle, and a tilt-back headstock for enhanced sustain. Sleek maple binding, matching maple rosette, and the 6-in-line headstock punch up the Malibu’s quintessential Fender vibe. With superb playability and unique aesthetics, the Malibu Special resonates with those destined to stand out from the crowd."

                    "Disrupt the status quo with the Malibu Classic, a small-body, short scale acoustic-electric with a comfortable feel that will encourage you to reach for new chords and melodies. Featuring solid mahogany top, back and sides, the bold style and balanced, articulate sound make the Malibu Classic a natural partner on stage and in the studio. Suitable for any playing style, the mahogany neck features a comfortable, slim-taper \"C\"-shaped profile, inspired by Fender’s electric legacy. It also includes a premium Fender- and Fishman-designed preamp system voiced specifically for the Malibu’s body shape, allowing you to reproduce the guitar’s natural sound when plugged into an amplifier. The Malibu Classic’s no-compromise attitude extends to its build quality, featuring quartersawn scalloped X bracing for superior resonance, an upgraded bone nut and saddle, and a tilt-back headstock for enhanced sustain. Sleek maple binding, matching maple rosette, and the 6-in-line headstock punch up the Malibu’s quintessential Fender vibe. With superb playability and unique aesthetics, the Malibu Special resonates with those destined to stand out from the crowd."

                "description": "Disrupt the status quo with the Malibu Classic, a small-body, short scale acoustic-electric with a comfortable feel that will encourage you to reach for new chords and melodies. Featuring solid mahogany top, back and sides, the bold style and balanced, articulate sound make the Malibu Classic a natural partner on stage and in the studio. Suitable for any playing style, the mahogany neck features a comfortable, slim-taper \"C\"-shaped profile, inspired by Fender’s electric legacy. It also includes a premium Fender- and Fishman-designed preamp system voiced specifically for the Malibu’s body shape, allowing you to reproduce the guitar’s natural sound when plugged into an amplifier.\nThe Malibu Classic’s no-compromise attitude extends to its build quality, featuring quartersawn scalloped X bracing for superior resonance, an upgraded bone nut and saddle, and a tilt-back headstock for enhanced sustain. Sleek maple binding, matching maple rosette, and the 6-in-line headstock punch up the Malibu’s quintessential Fender vibe. With superb playability and unique aesthetics, the Malibu Special resonates with those destined to stand out from the crowd.",

                    "Purpleheart fretboard produces a rich mid range with a crisp high end. Ibanez Advantage™ bridge pins - These pins really are an advantage over old-fashioned pins. Advantage™ pins are easier to take out and easier to put in than standard pins. A special bulb-shaped end makes the pin easy to grip and also prevents the pin from being pushed in too far. Best of all, with Advantage™ the pin and string stay put. Spruce top remains the most popular wood for acoustic guitar tops, mainly due to its pristine tonal clarity. Sapele back and sides offer a full-bodied and warm mid-range and a bright tone. The Ibanez T-bar Undersaddle pickup accurately translates that full sound to whatever amplification system you plug it into. AEQ-2T preamp is specifically-designed to adjust the frequencies of a bass and allows operation of the built-in tuner without the instrument being plugged in."

Advantage™ pins are easier to take out and easier to put in than standard pins. A special bulb-shaped end makes the pin easy to grip and also prevents the pin from being pushed in too far. Best of all, with Advantage™ the pin and string stay put. Spruce top remains the most popular wood for acoustic guitar tops, mainly due to its pristine tonal clarity. Sapele back and sides offer a full-bodied and warm mid-range and a bright tone. The Ibanez T-bar Undersaddle pickup accurately translates that full sound to whatever amplification system you plug it into. AEQ-2T preamp is specifically-designed to adjust the frequencies of a bass and allows operation of the built-in tuner without the instrument being plugged in.",

                    "More than 40 years after the Clash’s iconic album \"London Calling\" was released, Joe Strummer - the band’s articulate and fiery co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead singer - remains an incredible influence to players all over the world. The Joe Strummer Campfire guitar is inspired by the legendary campfires that he held at Glastonbury Festival and are now continued annually in the Strummerville area at the festival. Everyone was invited to join the party, with Strummer encouraging a loose assembly of people to his “campfire” to bond by the rising flames until dawn. This small-body acoustic-electric guitar is the perfect companion for gatherings of any size and to continue Strummer’s legacy of bringing people together through music. Boasting a solid spruce top with mahogany back and sides, the Campfire reflects Strummer’s legendary aesthetic with its matte black finish, nickel hardware and star inlays."

                    "Electric acoustic classical guitar. Yamaha CG-TA TransAcoustic classical nylon-string guitars transport you to new creative spaces with immersive reverb and lush chorus effects without an amp or other external gear. An actuator installed on the inner surface of the guitar back vibrates in response to the vibrations of the strings. The vibrations of the actuator are then conveyed to the body of the guitar and to the air in and around the guitar body, generating authentic reverb and chorus sounds from inside the body. Three simple knobs let you adjust the amount of effects and the line out volume level. Keeping the controls small minimizes the area of the holes in the body material, which reduces acoustic sound loss. The battery box integrated into the end-pin jack requires fewer holes in the body. This reduces acoustic sound loss. Connect the cable form the jack to a PA or amp to use as an acoustic-electric guitar."

                    "As soon as she burst onto the scene with her 2015 single “Ocean Eyes”, it was clear that Billie Eilish is a force to be reckoned with. In the years since, she has established herself as a new kind of pop culture icon, taking the fashion and music industries by storm on her own terms. Billie’s meteoric ascent to pop stardom started with the ukulele, the first instrument she learned to play. Designed in collaboration with Billie Eilish, her Signature Ukulele is a stage-ready instrument that embodies Billie’s bold, unmistakable style. This concert ukulele is built with sapele top, back, and sides, featuring a matte black finish with Billie’s “blohsh™” symbol. It also includes a Fishman Kula preamp for those looking to plug in. Whether you’re an experienced musician or looking to pick up your first instrument, one thing is true: you can play anything on the ukulele."

                "description": "As soon as she burst onto the scene with her 2015 single “Ocean Eyes”, it was clear that Billie Eilish is a force to be reckoned with. In the years since, she has established herself as a new kind of pop culture icon, taking the fashion and music industries by storm on her own terms. Billie’s meteoric ascent to pop stardom started with the ukulele, the first instrument she learned to play. Designed in collaboration with Billie Eilish, her Signature Ukulele is a stage-ready instrument that embodies Billie’s bold, unmistakable style. This concert ukulele is built with sapele top, back, and sides, featuring a matte black finish with Billie’s “blohsh™” symbol. It also includes a Fishman Kula preamp for those looking to plug in. Whether you’re an experienced musician or looking to pick up your first instrument, one thing is true: you can play anything on the ukulele.",
