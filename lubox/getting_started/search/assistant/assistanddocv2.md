Luigi's Box Assistant can learn from user interactions to provide better recommendations. To enable learning, integrate Luigi's Box Search Analytics service with your website by following [the instructions](/analytics.html).

## Integration Guide

### Building a Conversation Flow

The Assistant API is designed to create a conversational product discovery experience. Hereâ€™s how to implement a basic flow:

1. **Start the conversation**: Make an initial request with only the `tracker_id`, `assistant_handle`, and `assistant_version` parameters.
2. **Present options**: Display the question and options returned in the response to the user.
3. **Track selections**: When a user selects an option, add this interaction to the `steps` array in your next request.
4. **Show results**: Display the products returned in the `hits` array at each stage of the conversation.
5. **Continue the conversation**: The API will automatically determine the next most relevant question based on previous answers, or you can specify the next question using `next_question_handle`.

### Price Range Display

The Assistant API automatically calculates price ranges for each option, helping users understand the price distribution of products that match each option. This is calculated using the field specified in the `price_field` parameter (defaults to `price_amount`).

## Best Practices

### Design Effective Questions

Create questions that help users narrow down their choices effectively. Each question should:
- Address a specific aspect of the product selection process.
- Have options that meaningfully divide the product catalog.
- Present clear, concise option text.

### Track User Journeys

Analyze how users navigate through your assistant to optimize the question flow and product recommendations. Use the analytics integration to:
- Identify common paths through the assistant.
- Detect questions where users frequently abandon the process.
- Measure conversion rates from assistant interactions.

### Show Relevant Results Early

While the assistant is designed to guide users to the perfect product through a series of questions, showing relevant results early in the process can improve user satisfaction. The API returns matching products at each step, so consider:
- Displaying a selection of top matches alongside questions.
- Highlighting the diversity of available options.
- Showing how each answer changes the result set.

### Ensure Mobile Compatibility

Design your assistant interface to work well on mobile devices, where users may prefer a guided experience over traditional filtering.
