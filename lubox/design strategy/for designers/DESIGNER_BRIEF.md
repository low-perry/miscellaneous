## 📐 3 Key Layout Templates to Redesign

### 1. Main Layout - Standard Documentation Pages
**Current Issues**:

- No visual hierarchy beyond headings
- Mobile experience needs work

**Design This**:
- Cards/tiles for content organization
- Better visual hierarchy  
- Responsive column behavior
- Navigation patterns

### 2. Overview Layout - Integration Choice Pages  
**Current Issues**:
- Choice cards look basic
- Grid layout could be more engaging
- "Recommended" labels need design

**Design This**:
- Engaging choice card system
- Better grid layouts and spacing
- Visual badges and labels
- User decision flow

### 3. Quickstart Layout - Tutorial Pages
**Current Issues**: 
- No step visualization
- Plain title + content structure
- No progress indication

**Design This**:
- Step-by-step visual flow
- Progress indicators
- Mobile-friendly tutorial experience

## 💭 Key Design Questions

1. **How should we make technical docs feel less intimidating?**
2. **What card/tile patterns work best for our content?**
3. **How do we guide users through complex information?**
4. **What mobile patterns work for documentation?**
5. **How can we add personality without being unprofessional?**

---

## 📱 Responsive Strategy Needed

**Mobile** (< 768px): Single column, what navigation pattern?
**Tablet** (768-1024px): Two columns, how do cards adapt?  
**Desktop** (> 1024px): Three columns, optimal proportions?

---

## 🚀 Start Here

1. **Screenshot current pages** to understand what exists
2. **Sketch mobile-first** - how should docs work on phones?
3. **Design card systems** - tiles, spacing, hover states
4. **Plan user flows** - discovery → implementation journey
