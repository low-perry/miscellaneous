# Design Brief: Luigi's Box Documentation Redesign

## Project Overview

**Role**: You are designing the visual and UX improvements for Luigi's Box documentation  
**Developer**: Technical writer will implement your designs using existing Middleman + Bootstrap setup  
**Goal**: Create a modern, professional documentation experience that reflects Luigi's Box brand quality  

---

## 🎯 Design Challenge

**The Problem**: Current documentation looks functional but lacks visual polish and consistent design patterns that reflect our premium product quality.

**Your Mission**: Design the visual systems, layouts, and user experience improvements. Focus on:
- Visual hierarchy and information design
- Layout patterns and component styling  
- Color usage and typography decisions
- User journey and navigation patterns

---

## 📐 Layout System Analysis

We currently have **3 main layout templates** that need your design attention:

### 1. **Main Layout** (`layout.erb`)
**Current Structure**: 3-column layout (nav, content, TOC)
```
[Header Navigation]
[Side Nav] [Main Content] [TOC]
[Footer]
```

**Design Opportunities**:
- 📱 **Responsive behavior** - How should columns stack/hide on mobile?
- 🎨 **Content area styling** - Cards, sections, visual hierarchy
- 📏 **Spacing and proportions** - Column widths, gutters, padding
- 🔍 **Content density** - How much information per screen?

**Questions for You**:
- Should we use cards/tiles to organize content sections?
- How can we make the content area feel less "texty" and more visual?
- What's the ideal content width for readability?

### 2. **Overview Layout** (`overview_layout.erb`)  
**Current Structure**: Grid of choice cards + advantages lists
```
[Title + Intro]
[2x2 Grid of Choice Cards]
[Advantages Lists]
[Additional Content]
```

**Design Opportunities**:
- 🃏 **Card design system** - Current cards are basic, need personality
- 📊 **Grid layouts** - Better use of space, visual alignment
- ✅ **Advantage presentation** - Currently just checkmark lists
- 🏷️ **Labels and badges** - "Recommended" tags need design

**Questions for You**:
- How should we make the choice cards more engaging and distinctive?
- Should advantages be integrated into cards or separate?
- What visual cues help users pick the right integration path?

### 3. **Quickstart Layout** (`quickstart_layout.erb`)
**Current Structure**: Simple wrapper with title
```
[Quickstart Title]
[Step-by-step Content]
[Next Steps Section]
```

**Design Opportunities**:
- 📋 **Step visualization** - How to show progress and steps clearly?
- 🎯 **Goal-oriented design** - Getting users to success quickly
- 📱 **Mobile-first approach** - Quickstarts are often used on mobile
- ⏭️ **Next steps presentation** - Clear calls-to-action

**Questions for You**:
- How do we make step-by-step flows feel guided and encouraging?
- What visual elements help users track their progress?
- How should we highlight the "what's next" actions?

## 🎨 Brand Foundation (Already Established)

**Colors** (don't change these):
- Primary Purple: `#682175` 
- Secondary Cyan: `#47bcd6`
- Success Green: `#09A921`

**Typography** (system is set):
- System font stack (good for performance)
- Current hierarchy works, but needs better spacing

**What You Should Focus On**:
- How to use colors effectively throughout layouts
- Typography spacing, line-height, and hierarchy refinements
- When to use purple vs cyan vs neutral colors

---

## 🧩 Component Design Needs

### High Priority Components:
1. **Choice Cards** (overview pages) - Need personality and clear hierarchy
2. **Step Cards** (quickstart guides) - Should feel progress-oriented  
3. **API Endpoint Cards** - Technical content needs better presentation
4. **Navigation States** - Active, hover, focus states need design
5. **Code Examples** - Better integration with surrounding content

### Design Questions:
- Should cards have shadows, borders, or other depth indicators?
- How do we make technical content (APIs) feel approachable?
- What visual patterns help users scan and find information quickly?
- How can we add "delight" moments without being distracting?

---

## 📱 Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoints to Consider**:
- Mobile: < 768px (single column, stacked navigation)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (2-column, collapsible nav)  
- Desktop: > 1024px (3-column layout with TOC)

**Your Design Decisions Needed**:
- 📱 **Mobile navigation** - Drawer? Tabs? Accordion?
- 📊 **Content reflow** - How do 2x2 grids become mobile-friendly?
- 🔍 **Search placement** - Always visible? Part of nav? Floating?
- 📏 **Touch targets** - Minimum sizes for mobile interactions

---

## 🎯 User Experience Goals

### Primary User Journeys:
1. **First-time visitor** → Find right integration path → Get started
2. **Existing user** → Find specific API reference → Copy/implement  
3. **Troubleshooting** → Search for solution → Follow fix steps

### Design Success Metrics:
- **Findability** - Can users locate what they need in < 30 seconds?
- **Scannability** - Can users quickly assess if content is relevant?  
- **Actionability** - Are next steps always clear?
- **Mobile usability** - Is experience good on phones/tablets?

---

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints (Don't Worry About These)

**What the developer will handle**:
- Bootstrap integration and CSS implementation
- Responsive grid systems and breakpoints
- Middleman templating and Ruby logic
- Performance optimization and browser compatibility

**What you should design for**:
- Standard web patterns (cards, grids, lists)
- CSS-friendly layouts (no complex positioning requirements)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Existing content structure
