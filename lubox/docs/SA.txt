# Shopping Assistant API

Use the Shopping Assistant API endpoint to design interactive, guided product discovery experiences tailored for your users.

This API endpoint navigates conversation flows you have already created. To get started first create an assistant in the [Luigi's Box app](https://app.luigisbox.com).

Luigi's Box Assistant can learn from user interactions to provide better recommendations. To enable learning, integrate Luigi's Box Search Analytics service with your website by following [the instructions](/analytics.html).

## Integration guide

### Building a conversation flow

The Assistant API is designed to create a conversational product discovery experience. Here's how to implement a basic flow:

1. **Start the conversation**: Make an initial request with only the `tracker_id`, `assistant_handle`, and `assistant_version` parameters.
2. **Present options**: Display the question and options returned in the response to the user.
3. **Track selections**: When a user selects an option, add this interaction to the `steps` array in your next request.
4. **Show results**: Display the products returned in the `hits` array at each stage of the conversation.
5. **Continue the conversation**: The API will automatically determine the next most relevant question based on previous answers, or you can specify the next question using `next_question_handle`.

**Example conversation flow**

```javascript
const TRACKER_ID = "YOUR_TRACKER_ID";
const ASSISTANT_HANDLE = "Webinar Guitars";
const ASSISTANT_VERSION = -1;
const API_ENDPOINT = "https://live.luigisbox.com/v1/assistant";
const USER_ID = "some_user_id";

let steps = []; // This array will store the history of the conversation.

// Initial API call to start the conversation
async function startConversation() {
  const url = `${API_ENDPOINT}?tracker_id=${TRACKER_ID}&assistant_handle=${ASSISTANT_HANDLE}&user_id=${USER_ID}`;
  const payload = {
    assistant_version: ASSISTANT_VERSION,
    steps: [], // Sending an empty array
  };

  const response = await axios.post(url, payload);
  renderQuestion(response.data);
}

function handleOptionClick(questionHandle, selectedOption) {
  // 1. Record the answer by adding it to our state array
  steps.push({
    question_handle: questionHandle,
    option_handles: [selectedOption.option_handle], // API expects an array
  });

  // 2. Get the handle for the next question from the selected option
  const nextQuestionHandle = selectedOption.next_question_handle;

  // 3. Call the API again with the updated steps and the next question handle
  callAssistantAPI(nextQuestionHandle);
}

async function callAssistantAPI(nextQuestionHandle = null) {
  const url = `${API_ENDPOINT}?tracker_id=${TRACKER_ID}&assistant_handle=${ASSISTANT_HANDLE}&user_id=${USER_ID}`;
  const payload = {
    assistant_version: ASSISTANT_VERSION,
    steps: steps, // The steps array now contains the user's history
  };

  // Add the handle to the payload to continue the conversation flow
  if (nextQuestionHandle) {
    payload.next_question_handle = nextQuestionHandle;
  }

  const response = await axios.post(url, payload);
  renderQuestion(response.data);
}

function renderQuestion(data) {
  if (data.question && data.question.options.length > 0) {
    // Render the question and options...
  } else {
    // No more questions, the conversation is over.
    displayCompletionMessage();
  }
}
```

### Price range display

The Assistant API automatically calculates price ranges for each option, helping users understand the price distribution of products that match each option. This is calculated using the field specified in the `price_field` parameter (defaults to `price_amount`).

## Analytics and performance tracking

Once your assistant is live, you can measure its performance and understand user behavior through the Shopping Assistant Analytics dashboard in the [Luigi's Box app](https://app.luigisbox.com/users/sign_in).

### How analytics are collected

Luigi's Box tracks analytics in two ways: automatically through its servers, and manually via events you set up.

**What's tracked automatically:**

Every API call you make is logged. This means Luigi's Box automatically tracks the entire conversation flow: which questions were shown, which answers were selected, and which products were displayed in the `hits` array (this is the `"Assistant Listing"` event). This powers metrics like `Activation Rate` and `Completion Rate`.

**What you must track manually:**

To measure the assistant's business impact, you must manually report what users do after the products are displayed. To enable key metrics like `Conversion Rate` (CVR) and `Click-Through Rate` (CTR), you must send events when a user acts on a product shown by the assistant:

- `Clicks`: Report a [`click`](/analytics/api.html#event-api-click-event) event when a user clicks on a product card.

- `Conversions`: Report a [`conversion`](/analytics/api.html#event-api-conversion-event) event (e.g., "add to cart") when a user takes a conversion action on a product.

For detailed instructions on implementing these events, please refer to the Event API documentation.

### Key metrics you can track

By ensuring full event tracking is in place, you can unlock powerful insights in your analytics dashboard, including:

- **`Activation Rate`**: The percentage of users who start a conversation after seeing the assistant prompt.
- **`Completion Rate`**: The percentage of users who reach the final recommendation step after starting a conversation.
- **`Conversion Rate (CVR)`**: The percentage of users who add a product to their cart or purchase it after using the assistant.
- **`Exit Rate per Question`**: See which questions cause users to abandon the conversation, helping you identify confusing or unhelpful steps.

By monitoring these metrics in the Luigi's Box app, you can continuously refine your assistant's questions and flow to better guide users and improve performance.

## Best practices

### Design effective questions

Create questions that help users narrow down their choices effectively. Each question should:

- Address a specific aspect of the product selection process.
- Have options that meaningfully divide the product catalog.
- Present clear, concise option text.

### Track user journeys

Analyze how users navigate through your assistant to optimize the question flow and product recommendations. Use the analytics integration to:

- Identify common paths through the assistant.
- Detect questions where users frequently abandon the process.
- Measure conversion rates from assistant interactions.

### Show relevant results early

While the assistant is designed to guide users to the perfect product through a series of questions, showing relevant results early in the process can improve user satisfaction. The API returns matching products at each step, so consider:

- Displaying a selection of top matches alongside questions.
- Highlighting the diversity of available options.
- Showing how each answer changes the result set.

### Ensure mobile compatibility

Design your assistant interface to work well on mobile devices, where users may prefer a guided experience over traditional filtering.
