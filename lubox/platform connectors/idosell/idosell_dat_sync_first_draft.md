This guide explains what data is synced, how the synchronization works, and how to verify your data status.What Data is SynchronizedProduct InformationLuigi's Box syncs comprehensive product data from your IdoSell store. We fetch all parameters from productParameters for the selected language, excluding those marked for export (e.g., googleExport).Data TypeWhat's IncludedPurposeBasic infoName, description, short descriptionProduct identification and displayPricingAll active currencies for every productPrice-based filtering and sortingImagesAll image URLs (thumbnail is automatically selected)Visual search results and recommendationsCategoriesCategory structure and hierarchyCategory-based filtering and navigationInventoryStock availabilityDisplay in-stock products onlyAttributesSizes, colors, and all custom parametersFaceted search and filteringVariantsVariant options (grouped under master product)Detailed product selectionSynchronization LogicVariants: By default, variants are grouped under one "master" product ID.Visibility: Only products with productIsVisible: "y" are indexed. Hidden products are excluded to ensure search results are accurate.Images: We store all image URLs. The image_link attribute uses the first value from productImageSmallUrl.How Synchronization Works1. Initial Full SyncWhen: Immediately after our support team configures your integration.What Happens:Luigi's Box connects to the IdoSell API using your API Key.We download your entire product catalog in batches (100 products per request).We build the searchable index in the Luigi's Box system.Duration:The initial sync time depends on your catalog size. Because we must fetch 100 products at a time, very large catalogs (50,000+ items) may take several hours to complete.2. Ongoing Updates (Automatic Sync)Frequency: Automatic, every 3 hours (default).What Happens:Luigi's Box periodically polls your IdoSell store for the full product list.Full Reload: Unlike some platforms, IdoSell does not support "partial" updates for this integration type. We reload the full catalog during every cycle to ensure 100% accuracy.Latency: Changes made in IdoSell (e.g., price change, new product) will appear in search after the next 3-hour cycle completes.Technical Note:We do not use webhooks. This is a strict polling mechanism.Verifying Your DataSince IdoSell is a SaaS platform, you cannot run SQL queries to check your database directly. However, you can verify exactly what data IdoSell is sending to Luigi's Box by using the IdoSell API directly.Method 1: Check in the Luigi's Box DashboardThe easiest verification is within our tool:Log in to Luigi's Box.Go to Catalog → Browser.Check Product Count: Does the number of products match your IdoSell dashboard?Check Recent Changes: If you added a product >3 hours ago, search for it here. If it's missing, the sync might be failing.Method 2: Verify Raw Data via IdoSell API (Advanced)If you suspect data is missing (e.g., a specific attribute), you can inspect the raw data IdoSell is providing.Prerequisites:Your IdoSell Shop URLYour API Key (from the integration setup)Steps:Go to the IdoSell API Documentation for products/products/get.Use the "Try It" button (or use curl in your terminal).Headers:X-API-KEY: Paste your API Key here.Execute Request: This will return the raw JSON data for your products.What to look for:Search the JSON response for the missing product's ID.Check the productIsVisible field. If it is "n", Luigi's Box will not index it.Check the productParameters section to see if your custom attributes are present.TroubleshootingIssue 1: Integration Stopped Working (Silent Failure)Symptoms:Search results are outdated (old prices, old stock).New products aren't appearing after 24 hours.Common Cause: API Key RotationIf you regenerated your API Key in the IdoSell admin panel, the old key Luigi's Box uses is now invalid. There is no automatic notification for this failure.Solution:Immediately email support@luigisbox.com with your new API Key to restore synchronization.Issue 2: "Permission Denied" ErrorsSymptoms:Initial sync fails immediately.Support tells you they cannot connect.Common Cause:Your API Key lacks the specific Read/Write permissions required.Solution:Log in to IdoSell.Go to API → Access Keys to Admin API.Edit your key and ensure:CMS: Read and write (odczyt i zapis)PIM: Read and write (odczyt i zapis)System: Read only (tylko odczyt)Issue 3: Wrong Products in Multi-Language StoreSymptoms:English search results show Polish product names (or vice-versa).Common Cause:Misconfiguration of multi-site setup.Solution:Each language requires a separate Luigi's Box site configuration. Ensure you have provided support with the specific URLs/languages for every view you want to support. Do not try to use one script for all languages.Support ResourcesLuigi's Box Support:Email: support@luigisbox.comSupport Portal: https://help.luigisbox.com/
